- **Backend**: Convex (serverless, real-time)
- **Authentication**: Custom (already implemented)
- **Email**: Resend (already configured)
- **SMS** (Phase 5): Twilio or similar
- **Reports/PDF**: react-pdf or similar
- **Charts**: Recharts or Chart.js
- **Calendar**: react-big-calendar or FullCalendar

## Estimated Total Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 3-4 days
- **Phase 2**: 4-5 days
- **Phase 3**: 5-6 days
- **Phase 4**: 6-7 days
- **Phase 5**: 7-8 days

**Total**: ~25-30 days of focused development

This can be parallelized or adjusted based on priority and resources.
